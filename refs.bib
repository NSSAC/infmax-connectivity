  Abstract = {Social networks often serve as a medium for the diffusion of ideas or innovations. An individual's decision whether to adopt a product or innovation will be highly dependent on the choices made by the individual's peers or neighbors in the social network. In this work, we study the game of innovation diffusion with multiple competing innovations such as when multiple companies market competing products using viral marketing. Our first contribution is a natural and mathematically tractable model for the diffusion of multiple innovations in a network.We give a (1-1/e) approximation algorithm for computing the best response to an opponent's strategy, and prove that the "price of competition" of this game is at most 2. We also discuss "first mover" strategies which try to maximize the expected diffusion against perfect competition. Finally, we give an FPTAS for the problem of maximizing the influence of a single player when the underlying graph is a tree.}, Keywords = {competitive influence maximization, multiple diffusion processes, social networks, viral marketing}

abstract = "Given a weighted graph with some subsets of vertices called groups, the group Steiner tree problem is to find a minimum-weight subgraph which contains at least one vertex from each group. We give a randomized algorithm with a polylogarithmic approximation guarantee for the group Steiner tree problem. The previous best approximation guarantee was O(i2k1/i) in time O(nik2i) (Charikar, Chekuri, Goel, and Guha). Our algorithm also improves existing approximation results for network design problems with location-based constraints and for the symmetric generalized traveling salesman problem."
