\section{Related Work}
Many variants of the influence maximization problem have been considered, such as incorporating a deadline to the diffusion process \cite{chen2012time}, competitive opinions on the same network \cite{bharathi07competitive}, and considering friend/foe relationships \cite{li2013influence}. There has also been a lot of work on developing scalable algorithm for influence maximization \cite{borgs:soda14}.

To the best of our knowledge, influence maximization with connectivity constraints has not been explicitly proposed before. However, the more general problem of submodular function maximization with connectivity constraints has been studied by \cite{krause2006near} and, more recently, by \cite{kuo2015maximizing}, who propose a $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}})$ approximation algorithm for a solution of size $k$, which is the best-known bound.
